# here [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krlmlr/here.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krlmlr/here)

A simple interface to [`rprojroot`](https://github.com/krlmlr/rprojroot).


## Motivation

The logic to find a project root based on certain criteria is packaged in the
`rprojroot` package.
Many projects might not need the full power, and the complexity that comes with it.
Meet `here`:

```{r}
library(here)
here()
here("DESCRIPTION")
here("R", "here.R")
```


## Installation

Install from CRAN via
``` r
install.packages("here")
```

Install from GitHub via
``` r
devtools::install_github("krlmlr/here")
```
