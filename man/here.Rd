\usage{
here(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{\verb{[character]}\cr
Path components below the project root, can be empty.
Each argument should be a string containing one or more
path components separated by a forward slash \code{"/"}.}
}
\description{
\code{here()} uses a reasonable heuristics to find your project's files, based on
the current working directory at the time when the package is loaded.
Use it as a drop-in replacement for \code{\link[=file.path]{file.path()}}, it will always locate the
files relative to your project root.
}
\details{
This package is intended for interactive use only.
Use \code{\link[rprojroot:root_criterion]{rprojroot::has_file()}} or the other functions in
the \pkg{rprojroot} package for more control,
or for package development.

If \code{here()} raises an error or otherwise behaves unexpectedly,
you may have attached \pkg{plyr} or another package
after \pkg{here}.
Correct this using
\href{https://conflicted.r-lib.org/}{the \pkg{conflicted} package},
or use \code{here::here("data", "df.rda")}.

here()
\dontrun{

\section{Project root}{
Starting with the current working directory during package load time, \code{here} will walk the directory hierarchy upwards until it finds a directory that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
\itemize{
\item contains a file \code{.here}
\item contains a file matching \verb{[.]Rproj$} with contents matching \verb{^Version: } in the first line
\item contains a file \code{DESCRIPTION} with contents matching \verb{^Package: }
\item contains a file \code{remake.yml}
\item contains a file \code{.projectile}
\item contains a directory \code{.git}
\item contains a file \code{.git} with contents matching \verb{^gitdir: }
\item contains a directory \code{.svn}
}

Once established, the root directory doesn't change during the active R session. \code{here()} then appends the arguments to the root directory.
